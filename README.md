## CS 747 - Foundations of Intelligent Learning Agents

Programming Assignments

1. Implemented various algorithms - **Epsilon Greedy**, **Round Robin**, **UCB**, **KL-UCB** and **Thompson Sampling** and compared the regrets over different horizons.
2. Implemented **Linear Programming** solver and **Howard's Policy Iteration** to find the optimal policy and the corresponding value functions. 
3. Estimated the Value Function for different states using **Model-Based** and **TD(lambda)**.
